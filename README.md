//How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
  Each loop will draw 1 line on the canvas.
  
//What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
  First: set x axis of the end of the first line into 10.
  Second: before the lines go to width-10, keep running the loop.
  Third: set the gap of the end between each lines into 10.

//How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?
  6 times
  
//What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?
  increase the value of the 10 in (i = i + 10) or increase the vaule of the i in (1 + (x.length - i))
  
//How can you make the ellipse trail longer?
  increase the 10 in (i = i + 10) could make trail longer
